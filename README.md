# SampleFlaskApp
 
A simple Flask application that calculates somebody's BMI. 

## How to Run this Application

If you are using Windows:

```
set FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run
```

If you are using MacOS:

```
export FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run
```

In other words, just replace that `set` with an `export` if you are using MacOS.
